        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>One of the key deciding factor, especially for the absolute beginner who are looking to make software
            development
            as the career option is how quickly S/he can learn any new language and how easy it is to do.<br><br>
            Python is tailor made to suit the needs for newbies, it is very beginner friendly and designed to be quickly
            learned and adopted. So as far as ease of use and design complexity is concerned Python fares better than
            Javascript.<br><br>Python supports a programming style that uses simple functions and variables without
            engaging in
            class definitions. However, for JavaScript, that’s all there is.<br><br>
            <b>JavaScript is most complex modern programming language comparatively to python.</b> </p>

    <!-- 2. -->
    <div class="bgimg_4">
        <div class="caption" style="top:30%;">
            <span class="border">2. Versatility</span>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Python is one of the most versatile programming language suited for</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Web development
            <li>ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) development
            <li>AI/ ML/ Data Analytics Development
        </ul>
        <p>Javascript is also quite handy when it comes to Web development, ERP development, but considering the future
            market trends of AI/ML Javascript is not well suited. It is quite new in this arena and still has a long way
            to go.<br>Python has already made its name as one of the most preferred language for Data statistics &
            numerical handling, AI/ML algorithm handling .<br><br>

            One thing which actually fares well for Javascript is its ability to be used both as a front-end language
            and as a backend language. It’s very well suited for full-stack development need of programmers. Also, when
            it comes to Mobile app development Javascript score well over Python, as python is majorly a backend
            language which runs mostly on the server side.

            So here both languages are neck to neck in terms of its utility and versatility. Python has a strong
            community being the oldest player always gets the preference from lots of newcomers. But for me both are
            great it just boils down to the need of the developer which will influence the choice .</p>

    <div class="bgimg_5">
        <div class="caption" style="top:30%;">
            <span class="border">3. Performance</span>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Well, this comparison is not very easy as there are multiple factors involved, but the fair way to analyze
            would be to compare NodeJs and Python, keeping backend in perspective.

            In case of speed Node is significantly faster. This great performance is largely due to Node.js being based
            on Chrome’s V8, which is a very fast and powerful engine. This performance of NodeJS allows it to be apt for
            building realtime applications.<br><br>

            NodeJS even though is single threaded it has an event-based architecture and non-blocking I/O that helps it
            to maximize the usage of CPU and computer memory. These event-driven architecture is based on asynchronous
            calls that allow the Node.js servers to process more concurrent requests as compared to the multi-threaded
            servers. As it’s non-blocking I/O do not block program execution under I/O-heavy workloads, it helps improve
            the Node.js application runtime performance. These factors, in turn, make Node.js servers faster and
            productive and also provide the fastest server-side solutions.</p>

    <!-- 4. -->
    <div class="bgimg_2">
        <div class="caption" style="top:30%;">
            <span class="border">4. Scalability</span>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>When it comes to scalability we need to understand how effective the language is in handling large user
            traffic and also how these are handled using minimum server utilization. Server side resource optimization
            and large user base handling decides how much your product is scalable.

            It also depends upon the coder’s skill if he writes an optimized code that can be scaled, it helps the
            project to be flexible and scalable else no matter what language or server side language you use you may end
            up messing.

            Python, does not support asynchronous programming by default as compared to NodeJs, but it supports
            coroutines with which asynchronous processing can be easily achieved. So, even if its architecture may seem
            not as scalable as that of Nodejs, Python has the tools with which necessary scalability can be reached.
            NodeJs though look like designed for speed and scalability, but I would leave it to the developer to decide
            as again it is contextual and need dependent.

            Python can also scale very well. See YouTube and Instagram are two great products using Python.</p>
        <p>Python also scales in two directions that Node doesn’t :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>code complexity: Python is well suited to developing large size projects , python gives you an ease to
                code complex projects where NodeJs may sometimes will pose difficulty due to its asynchronous
                programming.
            <li>Wider domain: Python is great at putting a web-app together and everything else
        </ul>
        <p>So it all boils down to the need and the given goal a product/project is trying to achieve which should be a
            deciding factor.</p>

            <span class="border">5. Career Growth Opportunity</span>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Recently Javascript being a full-stack language is being hyped a lot and also people with MEAN stack
            knowledge are paid well. Javascript is becoming popular among big shot tech giants and is being used either
            as front-end or backend language. Having said that Python is equally rewarding as it is very well suited for
            Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning stuff, Data analytics. If you are eyeing a great career
            considering both current and future Python is a great choice.<br><br>

            I feel both are winners in their own way, if you want to be a full-stack developer and like to develop
            scalable mobile & web solutions javascript will be an advantage. But if you want to be a data scientist/data
            engineer Python will be a go 2 language. Both of these are well paying and growth oriented language so make
            your choices suiting to your hunger and most importantly keeping your vision as a programmer.</p>
